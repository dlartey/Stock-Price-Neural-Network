# Stock-Price-Neural-Network

A Recurrent Neural Network/ LSTM Network that uses Yahoo finance API to fetch the
price of a stock ticker symbol from the last x days to predict the
closing price of a stock for the next day

Utilises Python and TensorFlow

To Do List
+ Create website where parameters can be customised to see how well model performs
+ Compare model with different stock price tickers to see which provides best accuracy
+ Deploy to AWS using an EC2 instance or using beanstalk with flask/django
+ Create a docker container which can be run on any machine containing docker
+ Add an option where you can select different ML models to choose from
+ Calculate accuracy of each model and store it in a database of some sort
